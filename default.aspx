                                <br />Situated just 10 kilometres outside of Velddrift on the Pieketberg road, the LAPA was built on a private farm deep in the bush for a truly secluded outdoors experience.
                                The LAPA is located approximately 30 KM away from two popular West Coast towns: Vredenburg and Langebaan. This means you will be close to all the best golf courses and activities the area has to offer while experiencing a magic break-away in the bush. Visit the Volstruisvlei Bush Lapa during the popular crayfish and flower seasons on the West Coast.
                                The Bush Lapa concept originally began as a family vacation spot, but due to much interest and the popularity for its location, we’ve extended the guest list and opened the doors to other outdoors and camping enthusiasts.
                                As a guest, you’ll enjoy peaceful evenings around camp fires with the night sounds of nature all around you. Treat yourself, your family or your friends to an outdoors experience.
                                Travelling between the main farm house and the Bush LAPA, located 2.5KM into the bush requires a 4X4 vehicle. No 4X4? No fuss. Your host will be happy to transport you from the main farm house to the Bush LAPA.

                                Alternatively, two (2x) quad bikes are available for rent upon request prior to booking. Please note: The use of the quad bikes are for travelling to and from the Bush LAPA only. No unauthorised riding of the quad bikes is permitted.
                                Enjoy a camping accommodation experience that can house between 14 and 20 people (on request). The Bush LAPA is equipped with everything you will need to make your stay comfortable. Upon your arrival you will find bedding, warm water, bathroom amenities, a bread oven, a music player, and kitchen utensils. You will also have access to both inside and outside braai facilities.
                                You can just arrive, relax and kick off your shoes.
                                Minimum of 2 nights stays, per booking.
                                This is the perfect venue for team building, private parties, and as a family break-away type venue.
                                You will be on the farm in the bush, yet close to all the other activities the area has to offer.
